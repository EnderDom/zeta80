zeta80
======

My attempt at a z80 emulator, also an opportunity to get better aquainted with C

Currently still a work in progress, on again off again type of thing. The only component which currently
works is the assembler, which is just a glorified text parser.

I've made this public as a examplar of me A) Learning new languages B) That I can write code which is reasonable, hopefully?
